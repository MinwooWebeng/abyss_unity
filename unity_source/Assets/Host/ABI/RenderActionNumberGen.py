# Renumber trailing numbers in the first `oneof inner { ... }` block of RenderAction.proto.
#
# Updated rule:
# - If a paragraph does NOT begin with a `//N` comment, its base = previous paragraph's base + 100.
# - If it's the FIRST paragraph and has no comment, start at 100.
#
# Other rules (unchanged):
# - Paragraph = consecutive non-empty lines; blank/whitespace-only lines separate paragraphs.
# - If the first non-empty line of a paragraph is a comment like `//12 ...`, use N=12 → base = 1200.
# - Only change numbers on lines that END with "<number>;" (spaces around ';' allowed).
# - Preserve all other text/spacing verbatim.
#
# Always edits "RenderAction.proto" in place. No CLI and no __main__ guard.
